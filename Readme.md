# SMART MEDICAL RECORDS
This a ***Azle*** Smart Contract that let's a person store their medical records(Records can be generalized to any document uploaded on the IPFS). This let's the user store their data forever on the blockchain, while also making sure no-one apart from them can access it(Implemented through access control and caller checks). This is a prototype version and the use case can be extended to allowing to share with chosen people, NFT Holders etc.
